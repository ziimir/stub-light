# Light Stub

### Purpose

This stub is for fun with client-side vanilla javascript (dom api, etc)

### Build Feautres

All stuff are bundling in IIFE, node_modules/ and src/ builds in separate bundles

All imports are simply glued into one big file, without any separation on modules in outputed bundles\
So you need to use typescript namespaces

No production build - no need

### Build Process

Use makefile
